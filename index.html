        <p>Howdy, I'm Joseph, a sophomore at Austin High. Head to the Resume page to see my qualifications, skills, acheivements, and experience. The hobbies page showcases some of my favorite things to do outside of school and some information about them. On the programs page you will find programs that I have coded that I consider my best work.  This website is for the purpose of getting you better aquainted with me and my skills. The entire website was personally made by me with the html and css languages, so I hope you enjoy it.</p>
