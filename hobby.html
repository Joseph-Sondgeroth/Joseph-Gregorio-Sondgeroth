        <p>When I'm not engaged in school activies I have many ohobbies that I like to spend my time on. Here are my favorites.</p>
        <p> <h2>Music</h2> </p>
        <p>Throughout my life, in pre-school, elementary, middle, and high school, making and listening to music has been one of the biggest parts of my life. While for many years singing was my main medium, I found in middle school that the <span style="color:maroon;font-weight:bold">trombone</span> fit me much better. Since then I've participated in musicianship in and out of school and have been loving making music. Recently, I've also been dabbling in the piano.</p>

        <p> <h2>Gaming</h2></p>
        <p>Gaming also plays (get it?) a large role my freetime. I've been playing video games since I was 6 and my family got a Wii. Since then it has helped start friendships with friends and give also has given me a way to interact with friends who no longer live in Austin or go to school with me anymore. My favorite genre is the fighting game genre, but I mostly play fps games with my friends. My favorite game right now is Street Fighter V but with the sixth installment of the series on the horizon, I thought I'd include it's logo below.</p>
